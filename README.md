# Epic NFTs

This project uses React for frontend. The smart contract is written using solidity.

You can mint NFTs and show them to your friends and family. The NFTs are combination of random words from an array of selected words. You can see how many NFTs are minted and you can view the collection on Rarible and OpenSea
